Written By Claudius Coenen / MESO Web Scapes <coenen@meso.net>

Did you ever wonder whether your website's Tab is currenlty visible or not?
This JavaScript will broadcast events when it detects that a tab
gets choked by a browser.

Works in

* Firefox 5 (background tab only, will occasionally think it's in the foreground)
* Chrome 14 (minimized or background tab)
